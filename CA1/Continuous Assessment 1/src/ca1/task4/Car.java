 * Task 4: “Remove duplicate object from array”

This task requires you to implement the equals() and hashCode() methods in the Car class. 
Two cars are equal if they have the same model and colour, regardless of make.

Implement the ‘toString()’ method of the Car class. 
The toString() should return a string representation of a Car. 
The format should be “<Make>, <Model>, <Color>”.   
Implement the ‘removeDuplicates’ method in the CarProcessing class. 
Your method should remove duplicates from the given array using the Car equals() method. 
Write unit tests for both the Car and the CarProcessing class.
