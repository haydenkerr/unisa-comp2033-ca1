/**This task does not have any tests associated with it.  
In this task, you are required to:

Implement the body of the ‘printWords’ method. 
Your method needs to print “words” within a loop. 
The method parameter determines the total number of times the loop should run. 
Add a ‘main’ method. 
Create an instance of the Loops object and call 
the ‘printWords’ method to verify your implementation.
