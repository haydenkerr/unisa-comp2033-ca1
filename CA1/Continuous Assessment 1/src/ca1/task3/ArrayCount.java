/*
 * Task 3: “Count occurrences of a string within an array”

This task requires you to count the number of occurrences of a 
given target within an array. 

You will need to implement the ‘count’ method contained within the ‘ArrayCount’ class. 
It is important to consider your unit tests prior to beginning this task. 
You will need to implement a number of tests to ensure your implementation is correct. 

Consider the following situations:
The target does not exist in the array, 
The target appears only once in the array, 
The target appears multiple times in the array
 */


public class ArrayCount {
	public int count(String[] array, String target) {
		return 0;
	}
}
